See Ka-deploy.txt and boot.txt in the doc directory.

There is no special configure script in the src directory. To compile, only type 'make' in the src directory.

If you want to use the multicast support :

1 - First compile rmtplib using ./configure && make && make install in rmtplib's directory then
compile with 'make' in the src directory. (make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains your /usr/local/lib or /etc/ld.so.conf)

2 - edit ka-deploy/src/Makefile and replace 'MCAST = no' by 'MCAST = yes', and run make (make clean if you already have compiled once)
