This directory contains a mini dhcp server very easy to setup and a tool to create a ISC-dhcpd config file.
The purpose of this server is to facilitate the discovery of the MAC addresses on your network.
The server might not work for you, as it is not fully compliant with the dhcp RFCs. (But it might as well, it works for me :))
To setup the server :
-edit /etc/ka/ka.conf file and adjust the parameters to match your network settings
-create a file with the list of IP addresses (one per line) that you want to give to your nodes. this file should be named 'data' and in the current directory. 
You can use the mkiplist script to create the file if you have a large set of contiguous IP addresses.

Then (as root) run dhcpd.pl, and boot your nodes.
The server will answer all dhcpd requests it receives, and create a list of IP/mac address pairs, that will be written to the data file.
(Make sure nobody but you sends dhcp requests during that time)

When installation of the cluster is over, run create_dhcpd_conf.pl to create a config file for the real dhcpd server (ISC dhcpd).

This mini server is functional but lacks compliance, stability, efficiency, etc, that's why I wrote create_dhcpd_conf.pl.

As far as I can remember, I wrote this server because the ISC/Linux 2.4 pair cannot use dynamic DHCP correctly (maybe it has been fixed).
