<P>
This file only describes the steps for he installation of Ka for a Linux cluster.
Other questions might be answered in <a href=Ka-deploy.html>Ka-deploy.txt</a> and <a href=boot.html>boot.txt</a>


<h2> Getting the files </h2><br>
<p>
First you must download the RPM's from the <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26218>download page</a> on sourceforge.<br>
ka-boot, ka-nfsroot and ka-server-host RPM's are to be installed on your dhcp/tftp/nfs server.<br>
ka-deploy-cluster-node must be installed on the cluster node to be cloned.<br>
<p>
If you don't want rpms, take the .tar.gz for ka-boot and ka-deploy and compile
them ( on a linux machine ! ), and then <a href=source_install.html>install them</a>.<br> 
ka-nfsroot only comes as a binary (has been built from the mini distribution Mininux (<a hrefp=http://mininux.free.fr>http://mininux.free.fr</a>)). 

</UL>
<h2> Configuration </h2>
  <h3>On the cluster node</h3>
 
<ul>
<LI>
Edit /etc/init.d/ka-postintall
There is a line <pre>server=</pre>
Just put there the name of your tftp server, for instance : <pre>server=myserver.mydomain.com</pre>
There is also an 'exit' line that is here to be sure you don't forget to edit this file, remove it.
This file SHOULD be customized to fit your needs.

<li>The cluster node MUST be configured to use dhcp to get its IP configuration.<br>
<li>You must check that your machines boot on their LAN card using the PXE protocol (in the BIOS settings).  

<LI>
You also need some software of the cluster node:
<UL>
<LI>GNU tar, and NOT version 1.13.19. Version 1.13.17 is OK, I don't know about
the others. (issues with hard links in 1.13.19). -- older versions probably
are NOT ok.

<LI>
tftp : tftp 0.16-2 is OK, tftp 0.17-4 is not (buggy tftp put).

<LI>a properly configured lilo

</UL>
If you have trouble finding correct versions for tar and tftp, just take the
ones from the nfsroot rpm.
</ul>
<BR><BR>

<h3>On the server</h3>

<ul>
<LI>First you must setup your dhcp server. see <a href=boot.html>boot.txt</a> for details.
<li>Then make sure that you have a tftp server running
<li>You must also add an NFS export for ka-nfsroot: add this line to /etc/exports : 
<pre>/tftpboot/NFSROOT (ro,no_root_squash)</pre>
And the restart your NFS server.
<li>The file /tftpboot/NFSROOT/tftpserver should contain the IP address of your tftp server.
<li>Edit /etc/ka/ka.conf to match your cluster configuration. Once this is done: <br>
<PRE>
$ cd /tftpboot
$ ./ka_range_set 1 50 ka_deploy.kbt
</PRE>
this will set up links so that all the machines from 1 to 50 have ka-boot
running the ka_deploy.kbt script on startup.
<PRE>
$ ./ka_range_step 2 50 install
</PRE>
(of course the numbers 2, 50 are only examples. Let's imagine you have a
50-node cluster and node 1 will be cloned on all other nodes)
<PRE>
$./ka_range_step 1 1 ready
</PRE>

<P>
These two commands will write files so that on its next reboot, node 1 will
just boot normally on its hard drive, and on their next reboot 
nodes 2 to 50 will do a network boot and run the installation program.

<li>
On the /tftpboot directory on the server you must also place a linux kernel
image for your machines that supports (without using modules):
<ul>
<li>your network interface card(s)
<li>IP autoconfiguration(bootp/dhcp)
<li>root filesystem on nfs
</ul>
<P>
Edit the ka_deploy.kbt script to match the filename of this kernel


<LI>Now you must edit the /tftpboot/NFSROOT/install and part files to fit 
your partition scheme. We use only one / partition on /dev/hda1, and one swap
on /dev/hda2. In any other case, you must edit these files. 
If your Linux nodes have more than one Linux partition (eg you have a /, a
/usr, etc.. and not only a /) you need to read the <a href=Ka-deploy.html>Ka-deploy.txt</a> documentation and
use a different command for the server than the default one.

<P>
Else just run ka-d-server as root on the node 1:
<pre>
root@node1$ ka-d-server -s icluster -n 49
</pre>
Explanation:
<PRE>
        -s icluster : the session name of this installation is 'icluster' : must
        match the name that is in the scripts in /tftpboot/NFSROOT on the server
        -n 49 : we install 49 nodes 
</PRE>

<P>
And boot the 49 nodes that must be installed. And that's it. Do a tail -f on
/var/log/messages on the server, watch the screen of the node 1 and one of the
other nodes to check what's going on.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Troubleshooting:</A></H1>

<UL>
  <LI>On the client, tar prints : 
tar : could not create directory : no such file or directory
-&gt;This is normal, see BUGS

  <LI>On the client, tar prints lots and lots of error messages :
-&gt;you probably have a wrong version of tar

  <LI>During the second boot, ka-postinstall writes :
'PB de tftp'
-&gt; you propably have a buggy version of tftp. If not, check the file tree in
/tftpboot, the rights on the kaspteps/ files (they must be world-writable),
and see in the logs of your tftp server

  <LI>During the first boot, the client does not find the server and fails on
'udp-find-server()' :
-&gt; your netmask may be wrong. check your dhcpd.conf, you must have specified
the subnet. If you still have trouble with udp, try to get rid of the -s
option on ka-d-client (edit /tftpboot/NFSROOT/install) and use the -h option
(see <a href=Ka-deploy.html>Ka-deploy.txt</a> for help)
