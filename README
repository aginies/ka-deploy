Ka-deploy is a tool designed to duplicate a machine running Linux on many machines at the same time, 
typically for installing a beowulf style cluster.
This software should be considered as alpha, but it works well on our hardware/network.
Read the files in the doc subdirectory, the INSTALL file, and rmtplib/README for more information.
